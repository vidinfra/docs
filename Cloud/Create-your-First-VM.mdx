<Note>You may see a message: “SSH might not be available for root user due to operating system initial setup. Please use the virtual console to access the system and configure the SSH server according to your needs.” This message will not affect your VM creation process. You can safely proceed. Check the [SSH guide here](Connecting-to-Your-Tenbyte-VM-via-SSH).</Note>

    - Enter a secure password. Password requirements:
        + At least one lowercase and one uppercase ASCII letter (a-z, A-Z)
