7. Configure Your VM for SSH Access
    - First, update your packages by running:
      ```bash
      sudo apt update
      ```
    - Next, open the SSH configuration file:
      ```bash
        vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
      ```
    - Press ```I``` to enter insert mode.
    - Scroll down to the **Authentication section** and locate the line:
      ```bash
        #PermitRootLogin prohibit-password
      ```

    - Remove the ```#``` at the beginning and change the value to ```yes```:
      ```bash
        PermitRootLogin yes
      ```
