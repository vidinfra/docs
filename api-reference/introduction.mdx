Tenbyte is a global edge-cloud and security provider with **150\+ Points of Presence on six continents**. Every product is backed by a public, REST-style API so you can automate everything you do in the Customer Portal — or build entirely new experiences of your own.\\

**Why build on the API?**

- **Automate** routine tasks such as CDN cache purges, DNS record updates, or VM provisioning.
- **Integrate** Tenbyte services into CI/CD pipelines, Terraform workflows, Kubernetes Operators, or custom back-office tools.
- **Monitor & react** to real-time metrics or events and keep your infrastructure in a desired state.

Whether you’re shipping a simple web app or operating a multi-region SaaS platform, Tenbyte's APIs give you the same programmatic control used internally by our portal and SDKs.

3. Send the token as an _APIKey_ in the `Authorization` header:
