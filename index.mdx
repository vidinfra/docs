## What is Content Delivery Network?

CDN stands for Content Delivery Network. Works like a delivery shortcut for a website. 

Instead of sending all visitors or traffics to the origin server, a CDN keeps copies of website’s files like images, videos, etc. on many cache servers around the world. 

Therefore, the CDN gives the user the saved or cached files from the closest cache server when they visit a website.

## How does a CDN Works?
Here is a detailed breakdown of how a CDN works::

**1. Content Stored on the Origin Server:** A website’s static content, such as HTML files, images, videos, or scripts, is originally stored on the website’s main server, we can call it origin server too.

**2. Content Distributed to Edge Servers:** The origin server's static contents are temporarily stored by the CDN, which then distributes them to multiple edge or cache servers spread across various cities or regions worldwide. 

**3. User Requests Content:** A browser request for the cached website's content, such as a webpage, image, or video, is sent when a user accesses a website via a CDN.

**4. Routing to the Closest Server:** The request is sent to the nearest edge server by the CDN using geo-routing to identify the user's current location. For example, instead of the origin server in the United States, a user in Paris will be connected to an edge server in Europe.

**5. Content Delivered from the Edge Server:** The user's device gets the cached content from the edge server. Then the cached content loads more quickly because of the edge server's closer location, which lowers the latency.

**6. Handling Dynamic and Static Content:** Both static and dynamic content can be served using CDNs. If the content isn't already cached, the edge server may retrieve the latest version of dynamic content from the origin server. 

**7. Updating Cached Content:** To make sure the cached content remains relevant, CDNs continuously check the origin server. Then the CDN updates its cache to reflect changes made to the content of the website.
