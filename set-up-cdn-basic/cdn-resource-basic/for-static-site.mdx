This guide explains how to create and configure a **CDN distribution for static content**, such as images, CSS, JavaScript files & other assets that rarely change.



### Step 01: New Distribution Setup
When you first open the **“Create Distribution”** page, all fields will appear empty, ready for you to fill in.

The Save button will only appear once all required information has been completed.

### Step 02: Fill in distribution details
Fill in the distribution details by entering **Distributions Details**, choosing the **Domain Type**, and selecting the **Apropriate Cache Strategy**.


















Once the details are filled, the Distribution Overview section provides a summary of your configuration.

### Step 4: Manage SSL
If the user selects Custom SSL Certificate, they can either upload a new certificate or choose from existing certificates already available in their account.

1. **Let’s Encrypt SSL:** Automatically issue a free SSL certificate for your domain.

2. **Verify the CNAME**

3. **Certificate Issuing:** After completing CNAME verification, the SSL certificate is issued and applied to your distribution. It can takes few minutes.

4. **Custom SSL- Choose or Upload:** Upload your own SSL certificate files directly to Tenbyte. Ensure that the certificate and private key are valid and match your domain.

5. **Revoke SSL Certificate:** If you no longer want an SSL certificate applied to your CDN distribution, you can revoke the certificate.

6. **Use Tenbyte SSL:** Tenbyte provides a managed SSL option that can be applied directly to your CDN distribution without needing to upload a certificate.

### Step 5: Configure the Origin
Choose the source of your content, either a hostname or an S3 bucket, and provide the required information. Fill in the fields according to the type of resource you are connecting.
1. **Hostname**
    - Enter the origin label of your server for easy identification.
    - Include hostname and ip address where the content is stored.

2. **S3-Origin**
    - **Access Key ID:** Enter your cloud storage access key ID.
    - **Secret Access Key:** Enter your cloud storage secret access key.
    - **Bucket Name:** Specify the name of your S3 bucket, e.g., Tenbyte.
    - **Region:** Enter the S3 bucket region, e.g., us-east-1.

### Step 5 : Ready to Create Distribution

Once all required fields for creating the distribution are completed, a button bar will appear. This bar includes two buttons: **Create Distribution** to finalize the setup, and **Cancel** to discard the changes.

### Step 6: Distribution Status
After clicking Create Distribution, the system will process your request. You may encounter one of two outcomes:

1. **Distribution Successful**
    - A confirmation message will appear indicating that your CDN distribution has been successfully created.

    Your distribution will be listed in the CDN dashboard, ready to use.

2. **Distribution Failed**
    - If there is an issue, an error message will appear with Contact Support and Try again button.
    - Check the required fields, origin configuration, and SSL settings, then try creating the distribution again.
